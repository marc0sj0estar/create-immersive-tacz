# Create Immersive TACZ Integration

### Installation guide (Very important)

(If you're using a version of tacz older than 1.14, some folders are in .minecraft/config/tacz)

1.  Install the latest version of [**Forge**](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html)
2.  Install [**Create**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) version 0.5.1.f or above.
3.  Install [**Timeless and Classics Zero**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/timeless-and-classics-zero).
4.  Start Minecarft so Timeless and Classics Zero can create its directories.
5.  Install [**Create Amorer**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/tacz-create-armorer-koei) and extract to a folder in .minecraft/tacz
6.  Install this mod into the mod folder.

 

**Optional steps to remove the Create Armorer recipes of the gun bench (recommended)**

1.  Change the DefaultPackDebug option of .minecraft/tacz/tacz-pre.toml to true
2.  Go to .minecraft/tacz and open the create armorer zip you downloaded (you can use winrar). Delete the recipes folder in data/create\_armorer/recipes

 

**Extra step to delete all the vanilla workbench recipes**

3\. Go to .minecraft/tacz/tacz\_default\_gun/data/tacz and delete the recipes folder

This mod adds ways to **craft and automate** the guns, ammo and attachments from Create Amorer into an immersive Create experience.

Now the recipes of the guns are more realistic and the ammo can be manufactured in mass!

Only the Create Armorer Weapons are meant to be used, since they're the most fit for a create playthrough.

# **New Gun Parts!**

New items were added to serve as intermediary steps when crafting the weapons.

## **Gun Barrel**

# **New Gun Recipes!**

Since the TaCZ weapons are really powerfull compared to your usual minecraft and create weaponry, the recipes have been balanced using the new gun parts. Now you will need to have a components like precision mechanisms and mechanical crafters to craft them.

# **New Gun Attachment Recipes!**

A gun isn't complete without a few **attachemnts**, so more recipes have been added to make them.

# **New Ammo Casings!**

The **ammo casings** are made by sawing brass plates. You can put a filter with the casing of your choice using JEI to make it cut the sheets into that type.

# **New Fluids!**

**Gunpowder** can now be stored in tanks as fluids and used in the different recipes. If you have [Create Big Cannons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-big-cannons) installed, you can also store **Nitropowder**, which is more efficient than gunpowder at making primers.

# **New Ammo Recipes!**

To craft the ammo, **primers** are needed. These are made by injecting gunpowder or nitropowder into andesite casings.

![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1152431/description_9bfa81c9-a5df-42b6-8529-75e6c390987f.png)

![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1152431/description_e3120cf5-efc0-4422-ad7d-55e4d655a8f5.png)

Now that you have the primers, you can insert them into the casings and filll them up with gunpowder to craft you ammo type of choice.

![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1152431/description_07bc5695-766a-47bd-8aa8-f7ca6465a4b2.png)

You need to have brass for creating guns and manufacturing ammo so be sure to have reached that technology level when trying to make your new gun factories.

Apart from that, the process requires a large amount of andesite alloy, since it requires one alloy for every primer so be sure to at least have that process automated.

# FAQ

Q: There's an error when I launch the game.

A: Update forge. For some reason that fixes it.

Q: When I use the saw it crafts something else.

A: That means there's another mod with the same recipe. Use a filter in the saw so it only outputs what you need.

This mod has been primarily made for personal use, but if you have any suggestions about changes that should be made feel free to suggest them in the comments!
